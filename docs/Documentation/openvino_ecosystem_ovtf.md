# OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow {#ovtf_integration}

**OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** is a solution for TensorFlow developers who want to get started with OpenVINO™ in their inferencing applications. By adding just two lines of code you can now take advantage of OpenVINO™ toolkit optimizations with TensorFlow inference applications across a range of Intel® computation devices.

This is all you need:
```bash
import openvino_tensorflow
openvino_tensorflow.set_backend('<backend_name>')
```

**OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow** accelerates inference across many AI models on a variety of Intel® technologies, such as:
- Intel® CPUs
- Intel® integrated GPUs

> **NOTE**: For maximum performance, efficiency, tooling customization, and hardware control, we recommend developers to adopt native OpenVINO™ solutions.
To find out more about the product itself, as well as learn how to use it in your project, check its dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_tensorflow/tree/master/docs). 


To see what you can do with **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, explore the demos located in the [examples folder](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_tensorflow/tree/master/examples) in our GitHub repository.  

Sample tutorials are also hosted on [Intel® DevCloud](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/devcloud/edge/build/ovtfoverview.html). The demo applications are implemented using Jupyter Notebooks. You can interactively execute them on Intel® DevCloud nodes, compare the results of **OpenVINO™ integration with TensorFlow**, native TensorFlow, and OpenVINO™.
