# Compressing a Model to FP16 {#openvino_docs_MO_DG_FP16_Compression}

Model Optimizer by default converts all floating-point weights to `FP16` data type. The resulting IR is called
compressed `FP16` model. The resulting model will occupy about twice as less space in the file system, 
but it may have some accuracy drop. For most models, the accuracy drop is negligible. 
But in case if accuracy drop is significant user can disable compression explicitly.

By default, models are compressed to `FP16`, but you can disable compression by specifying `--compress_to_fp16=False`:
```
mo --input_model INPUT_MODEL --compress_to_fp16=False
```

For details on how plugins handle compressed `FP16` models, see [Working with devices](../../OV_Runtime_UG/supported_plugins/Device_Plugins.md).

> **NOTE**: `FP16` compression is sometimes used as the initial step for `INT8` quantization.
> Refer to the [Post-training optimization](../../../tools/pot/docs/Introduction.md) guide for more information about that.
