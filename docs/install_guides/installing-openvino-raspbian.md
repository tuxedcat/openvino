# Install OpenVINO™ Runtime for Raspbian OS {#openvino_docs_install_guides_installing_openvino_raspbian}

@sphinxdirective

.. note::

   * These steps apply to Raspbian OS (the official OS for Raspberry Pi boards).
   * These steps have been validated with Raspberry Pi 3.
   * There is also an open-source version of OpenVINO™ that can be compiled for arch64 (see `build instructions <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/wiki/BuildingForRaspbianStretchOS>`_).

## Step 1: Download and Install OpenVINO Runtime

@sphinxdirective

#. Open the Terminal or your preferred console application.
#. Create an installation folder for OpenVINO. If the folder already exists, skip this step.

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo mkdir -p /opt/intel

   .. note::

      The ``/opt/intel`` path is the recommended folder path for administrators or root users. If you prefer to install OpenVINO in regular userspace, the recommended path is ``/home/<USER>/intel``. You may use a different path if desired.

#. Go to your ``~/Downloads`` directory and download OpenVINO Runtime archive file for Debian from `OpenVINO package repository <https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2022.3/linux/>`_.

   .. tab:: ARM 32-bit

      .. code-block:: sh

         cd ~/Downloads/
         sudo wget https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2022.3/linux/l_openvino_toolkit_debian9_2022.3.0.9052.9752fafe8eb_armhf.tgz -O openvino_2022.3.0.tgz

   .. tab:: ARM 64-bit

      .. code-block:: sh

         cd ~/Downloads/
         sudo wget https://storage.openvinotoolkit.org/repositories/openvino/packages/2022.3/linux/l_openvino_toolkit_debian9_2022.3.0.9052.9752fafe8eb_arm64.tgz -O openvino_2022.3.0.tgz

#. Extract the archive file and move it to the installation folder:

   .. tab:: ARM 32-bit

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo tar -xf openvino_2022.3.0.tgz
         sudo mv l_openvino_toolkit_debian9_2022.3.0.9052.9752fafe8eb_armhf /opt/intel/openvino_2022.3.0

   .. tab:: ARM 64-bit

      .. code-block:: sh

         sudo tar -xf openvino_2022.3.0.tgz
         sudo mv l_openvino_toolkit_debian9_2022.3.0.9052.9752fafe8eb_arm64 /opt/intel/openvino_2022.3.0

#. Install required system dependencies on Linux. To do this, OpenVINO provides a script in the extracted installation directory. Run the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo -E ./install_dependencies/install_openvino_dependencies.sh

#. For simplicity, it is useful to create a symbolic link as below:

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo ln -s openvino_2022.3.0 openvino_2022

   .. note::

      If you have already installed a previous release of OpenVINO 2022, a symbolic link to the ``openvino_2022`` folder may already exist. Unlink the previous link with ``sudo unlink openvino_2022``, and then re-run the command above.


Congratulations, you finished the installation! The ``/opt/intel/openvino_2022`` folder now contains the core components for OpenVINO. If you used a different path in Step 2, for example, ``/home/<USER>/intel/``, OpenVINO is then installed in ``/home/<USER>/intel/openvino_2022``. The path to the ``openvino_2022`` directory is also referred as ``<INSTALL_DIR>`` throughout the OpenVINO documentation.

.. _install-external-dependencies:

@endsphinxdirective


## Step 2: Install External Software Dependencies

@sphinxdirective

CMake version 3.10 or higher is required for building the OpenVINO™ toolkit sample application. To install, open a Terminal window and run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt install cmake


CMake is installed. Continue to the next section to set the environment variables.

.. _set-the-environment-variables-raspbian:

@endsphinxdirective


## Step 3: Set the Environment Variables

@sphinxdirective

You must update several environment variables before you can compile and run OpenVINO applications. Open a terminal window and run the ``setupvars.sh`` script as shown below to temporarily set your environment variables. If your <INSTALL_DIR> is not ``/opt/intel/openvino_2022``, use the correct one instead.

.. code-block:: sh

   source /opt/intel/openvino_2022/setupvars.sh


If you have more than one OpenVINO version on your machine, you can easily switch its version by sourcing the ``setupvars.sh`` of your choice.

.. note::

   The above command must be re-run every time you start a new terminal session. To set up Linux to automatically run the command every time a new terminal is opened, open ``~/.bashrc`` in your favorite editor and add ``source /opt/intel/openvino_2022/setupvars.sh`` after the last line. Next time when you open a terminal, you will see ``[setupvars.sh] OpenVINO™ environment initialized``. Changing ``.bashrc`` is not recommended when you have multiple OpenVINO versions on your machine and want to switch among them.

The environment variables are set. Continue to the next section if you want to download any additional components.

.. _model-optimizer:

@endsphinxdirective


## Step 4 (Optional): Install Additional Components

@sphinxdirective

If you want to use your model for inference, the model must be converted to the ``.bin`` and ``.xml`` Intermediate Representation (IR) files that are used as input by OpenVINO Runtime. To get the optimized models, you can use one of the following options:

* Download public and Intel's pre-trained models from the `Open Model Zoo <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo>`_ using :doc:`Model Downloader tool <omz_tools_downloader>`. For more information on pre-trained models, see :doc:`Pre-Trained Models Documentation <omz_models_group_intel>`.

  * OpenCV is necessary to run demos from Open Model Zoo (OMZ). Some OpenVINO samples can also extend their capabilities when compiled with OpenCV as a dependency. To install OpenCV for OpenVINO, see the `instructions on Github <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/BuildOpenCV4OpenVINO)`_.

* Convert the models using the Model Optimizer. Model Optimizer is provided with OpenVINO Development Tools.

  * OpenVINO Development Tools is a set of utilities for working with OpenVINO and OpenVINO models. It provides tools like Model Optimizer, Benchmark Tool, Post-Training Optimization Tool, and Open Model Zoo Downloader. See the :doc:`Install OpenVINO Development Tools <openvino_docs_install_guides_install_dev_tools>` page for step-by-step installation instructions.
