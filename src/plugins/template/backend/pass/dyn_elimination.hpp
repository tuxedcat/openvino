/// The ConstantFolding and DynElimination passes are used together to transform

/// In the example shown below, the original graph is constructed with dynamic
/// broadcast operation. When the graph is executed with input data, the input
/// shapes become available, by applying the ConstantFolding and DynElimination
/// pass, the graph is updated with dynamic broadcast being replaced by a static
/// broadcast operation.
